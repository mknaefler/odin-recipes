<h3>Description</h3>
<p>These homemade french fries are potatoes that are cut into sticks and deep fried until golden brown, then sprinkled with seasonings. </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 1/2 pounds Russet potatoes</li>
    <li>oil for frying (I use vegetable or peanut oil)</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cut the potatoes into matchsticks, either with a knife or with a french fry cutter. The potato pieces should all be similar in size.</li>
    <li>Place the potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Soak the potatoes for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain the water from the potatoes. Place the potatoes on a layer of paper towels and pat thoroughly with additional towels until dry.</li>
    <li>Pour 3 inches of oil into a large, deep pot. Heat the oil to 300 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Place about 1/3 of the potatoes in the pot, and cook until tender. This takes about 4-5 minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes.</li>
    <li>Increase the heat of the oil to 400 degrees F. Place 1/3 of the potatoes back in the pot and cook for an additional 1-3 minutes or until golden brown. Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes. Place the cooked potatoes on a sheet pan lined with paper towels.
    </li>
    <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste over the fries. Add parsley if desired, then serve immediately.
